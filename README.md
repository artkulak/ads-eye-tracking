# Adds Eye Tracking Web App Project
This repository contains a web app which does eye tracking and emotion recognition for tracking user activity while watching adds.
The web app uses [WebGazer library](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) for eye tracking and [face-api-js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) for emotion recognition. All models run in the browser, which means you don't need to set up a separate server for the machine learning models!

Please see a video demo of the project [here](https://youtu.be/ukN6yciBask)
